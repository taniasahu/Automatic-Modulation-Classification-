# Automatic Modulation Classification using Deep Learning 

This project explores the use of deep learning to classify modulation schemes in radio signals which is an essential task in modern wireless communication systems. The main goal is to develop and compare various machine learning models that can reliably identify modulation types under real time conditions and across a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs). 
I generated a synthetic RF dataset using MATLABand then imported it into a deep learning model built in Python for training and evaluation.
